# fzf-haskell README

I have created this extension for my personal use. I use `hasktags` frequently to generate ctags for Haskell, and I was using another extension which parsed the ctags file, and allowed me to go to the definition of a function/type. The issue with that extension was that it didn't allow fuzzy matching. I wanted to be able to search for a function/type by typing a part of its name, and this extension allows me to do that.

Another thing that I wanted to do is to fuzzy search the contents of the entire workplace. I can do this using this extension too. I don't really like the `Find in Files` feature of VSCode, because it doesn't let me use arrow keys properly. It is a UI based search, and I inevitably have to use my mouse with it. Also, it does not have fuzzy search. I thought about creating a fuzzy search in TS/JS, but that would just have been a waste of time. Why not use a brilliant tool that already exists: `fzf`?

Current commands:
1. findTags - Fuzzy search the tags file generated by `hasktags`
2. findAll - Fuzzy search the entire workspace
3. regenerateTags - Regenerate the tags file

## Setup
```bash
cp src/scripts/fzf-haskell.sh ~/.config/bash/
```

Add this line to `.bashrc`
```bash
source ~/.config/bash/fzf-haskell.sh
```
